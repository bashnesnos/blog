<p>I'm a programmer.

Originally started with Java, and working mostly with Java all the time. But deep inside I always feel interest to all the other languages and techniques. At the moment I have a relatively long and enjoyable experience with Groovy (which doesn't really count as 'not Java language' but still) apart from Java.

In this blog I'm going to write about programming things I found interesting. Like funny/frustrating/astonishing things I came across during daily programmer's routine or in my spare time.</p>
